# 🧠 Machine Learning Capstone Project  
## *Fair and Automated Salary Determination Using Historical Data*

---

### 📘 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a *Machine Learning model* that helps ensure *fairness and consistency* in salary determination within a company.  
Currently, salary decisions often depend on human judgment, which can lead to unintentional bias or discrimination.  

To address this, the Human Resources (HR) department of *Company X* aims to use historical employee data — including experience, education, skills, and other attributes — to *automatically predict an appropriate salary range* for new candidates.  

By doing this, the company can *minimize bias* and make fair, data-driven salary decisions.

---

### 🎯 Goal & Objectives
- Build a predictive model using historical employee data.  
- Automatically determine salary ranges for new candidates.  
- Reduce human bias and subjectivity in salary decisions.  
- Create a transparent, explainable, and fair salary recommendation system.  
- Ensure the approach is robust and generalizes well across employee profiles.

### 🧩 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about individuals who applied to Company X.  
It includes multiple features such as:  
- Age  
- Education  
- Occupation  
- Workclass  
- Experience  
- Salary (Target variable)

*(Dataset was provided as archive.zip and extracted within Google Colab for model training.)*

### 🧪 Modeling Approach
1. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):*  
   Understanding feature distributions, correlations, and outliers.  

2. *Data Preprocessing:*  
   Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.  

3. *Model Building:*  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
   - Gradient Boosting / XGBoost  
   - Comparison of models to find the best performing one.  

4. *Model Evaluation:*  
   Evaluated using metrics such as *R² Score, **MAE, and **RMSE* to ensure model reliability.

### 📊 Results
- Successfully developed an ML model that predicts fair salaries based on historical data.  
- Reduced manual bias and ensured fair salary distribution across similar employee profiles.  
- Achieved high accuracy and interpretability on unseen data.

---

### 💡 Future Enhancements
- Deploy the model through a web-based HR dashboard.  
- Integrate *Explainable AI (XAI)* methods to understand predictions.  
- Continuously improve model accuracy using real-time data updates.
